## Educational Purpose Statement

This project was developed **exclusively for educational purposes** as part of cybersecurity engineering studies. The primary goals were:

1. **Understanding offensive techniques** - Learning how real-world attacks are conducted
2. **Learning malware architecture** - Studying how malicious software operates
3. **Researching detection evasion** - Understanding AV/EDR bypass methods through practical research
4. **Practicing secure development** - Implementing cryptographic protocols correctly

## Responsible Disclosure

The author has intentionally **NOT published**:

- ❌ The complete C++ implant source code
- ❌ Compiled binaries or executables
- ❌ Specific evasion technique implementations
- ❌ Working BadUSB payloads
- ❌ Any code that could be directly weaponized

Only the **C2 server infrastructure** (Python) and **documentation** are published, which:
- Cannot function as malware on their own
- Serve as educational reference for C2 architecture
- Demonstrate proper cryptographic implementations
